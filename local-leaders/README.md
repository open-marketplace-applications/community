## What are the responsibilities and objectives?

**Setup a local marketplace**
The most obvious objective is to set up a local marketplace and maintain it. In the best case you empower your region to be it's own platform provider, which means you might need some infrastructure and technical knowledge to do so. Since most `Local Leaders` might not have any technical skills, the second objective `build a team` can be a precondition to do so.

**Build a local OMA team**
A good starting point for a local team is having a developer, a designer, a marketer and a trustworthy person to manage finances. But there is no limit to the amount of team members a local team can have. It also depends heavily of the size of your region.

**Increase public awareness**
In order to succeed against competitors like amazon, the biggest hurdle is to convince the people from the advantages of a decentralized marketplace.

**Collect local data**
Most importantly we need extensive data about shops, to empower the local shops to compete against other e-commerce platforms. But there is lots of other data like public places, free-time activities, flora, fauna or even the weather that could provide valuable information.

**Provide Feedback**
It is really important to communicate problems, solutions and requirements from your region to the global OMA team.

**Verify new Local Leaders**
Our aspiration is to create a self-sustained management framework for `Local Leader` world wide. This is why you as a `Local Leader` can verify other local leaders. To verify a new `Local Leader`, two verified `Local Leaders` are required. They do the onboarding together and act as contact persons for questions.
