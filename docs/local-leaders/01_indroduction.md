# Local Leaders

A `Local Leader` brings the vision of [#OMA](https://openmarketplace.org) to their city - with the mission to build up a open marketplace and a local team, to fulfill the city needs.

## The role of a Local Local
A `Local Leader`is a contact-person and kwows everything thatâ€™s happening in their city.

## What do Local Leaders 
`Local Leaders` will create an marketplace and takes care of it.
The second step is to build an team within the city and collect feedback, report it and solve problems and build improvements with other local teams.  

## How many Local Leaders do we need?
