## Organs
There are two organs at #OMA: the board and the general assembly. The board meets regularly every two weeks and the general meeting once a year.

### Board
The board is represented by five to nine active members, who are responsible for at least one of the following units: chair, vice chair, finance, vice finance, community, events, editing, design and development. The office of Chair, Vice Chair, Finance and Vice Finance must be filled by different active members. However, these, as well as the other board members, may hold a total of two positions. The board meets every two weeks in a remote meeting and processes inquiries and requests from members and the community.

### Community
The general assembly consists of all members of the association. Each member has one vote here and decides on changes to the statutes and important concerns of the association. The general meeting meets once a year and constitutes the executive board there.

## Members
To become a member you have to be of legal age, close to our goals and to apply for membership. Each member has one vote in the general assembly. We differentiate between four types of membership:

Active members participate in the association's work and belong to at least one department.

Passive members only pay a membership fee annually, but do not actively participate in association work and do not belong to any department.

Honorary members can be appointed by the general assembly if members have rendered outstanding service to the association.

## Departments
Departments are different areas of activity of the association. Our lectures are chair, finance, marketing, design, development, events and community. Each unit has one - chair and finance two - representatives on the board. This means that there are up to nine board members in seven lectures. Each department has different tasks and areas of responsibility. In the design department there are, for example, graphics, UI / UX, audio and film. As an active member, you can freely choose which units you want to participate in and apply once a year for the position of head of unit. The head of unit, i.e. member of the board, also has strategic and organizational responsibility.
